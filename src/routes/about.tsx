            Most suppliers buy finished material and resell it. We buy blocks. That gives us control
            over thickness, finish and batch matching — and it removes a layer of margin that would
            otherwise land on your invoice.

            sanitary range, so a single delivery can finish a floor, a wall and a washroom.
